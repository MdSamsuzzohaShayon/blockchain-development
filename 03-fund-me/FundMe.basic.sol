     * The blockchain oracle problem refers to the inability of blockchains to access external data, making them isolated networks, akin to a computer with no Internet connection. Bridging the connection between the blockchain (onchain) and the outside world (offchain) requires an additional piece of infrastructureâ€”an oracle.
