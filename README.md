# Solidity & Blochchain Development

## Getting Started

## About
 - [IPFS's](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) versatility shines across different industries – making it the multi-purpose tool for the decentralized age.
 - Our peer-to-peer content delivery network is built around the innovation of content addressing: store, retrieve, and locate data based on the fingerprint of its actual content rather than its name or location.
    - **Open:** The IPFS network is distributed and participatory, which reduces the problem of data silos that plague central servers.
    - **Verifiable:** The integrity of all data is verified using hash functions, so you can trust that you always get the data you’re looking for.
    - **Resilient:** Files and data can be stored across multiple nodes, which keeps content at the ready even during critical outages.
