### Blockchain 00:06:25
 - **Bitcoin** was the first one to take blockchain mainstream
 - **Bitcoin** is like digital gold
 - Bitcoin can be used to make peer-to-peer transactions in a decentralized network. This network is powered by cryptography allowes prople to engage in censorship resistant finance in a decentralized manner.
 - **Ethereum** allows for smart contracts
 - Chainlink provides data and external compution to smart contract
 - Ethereum used the same blockchain infrastructure with an additional feature. Decentralized application, decentralized organization and build smart contracts and engage in agreements without third party, intermediary or centralized governing force.
 - Smart contract is a self-executing set of instructions that is executed without a third party intermediary
 - Bitcoin does also have smart contract however they are not touring complete, meaning, they don't have the full range of capabilities.
 - The ethereum protocol has given rise to many new paradigms and industries including d5, nfts, dows or decentralized
 - **Hybrid Smart Contract** combine on-chain and off-chain components
### Characteristics 00:15:06
 1. Decentralized - there is no centralized source that controls the blockchain, the individuals that make up blockchain are known as node operators
 2. Transparent - Everything that's done on a blockchain and all the rules that are made can be seen by everyone
 3. Speed
 4. Immutable - Blockchains are immutable which means they can't be changed. Because of this they can't be tampered with or corrumted in any way shape
 5. Remove counterparty risk
 6. Allow for trust minimized agreements
 7. Hybrid smart contracts combine on and off-chain

### Concept definations - (01:00:00)
 0. Get ideas of [blockchain](https://andersbrownworth.com/)
 1. **Hash** - Unique fixed length string to identify a peace of data
 2. **Hash Algorithms** - A function that computes data into a unique hash
 3. **Mining** - the process of finding solutions to the blockchain problem. e.g. The problem to find a hash that starts with 4 zeros. nodes get paid for mining block.
 4. **Block** - a list of transactions mined together
 5. **Decentralized** - having no single point of authority
 6. **Nonce** - a number used once to find the solution to the blockchain problem. It's also used to define the transaction number for an account/address.
 7. **Nonce** - a number used once to find the solution to the blockchain problem.
 8. **Private key** - Only known to the key holder, it is used to sign transactions
 9. **Public key** - is derived from private key. Anyone can see it, and use it to verify that a transaction came from.
 10. Private key -> public key -> address



### Testing with rinkeby
 - Install metamask chrome extension -> create account - download and save private key -> copy address -> scan address with __https://etherscan.io__ or __https://rinkeby.etherscan.io__ (for testing)
 - Make a tweet with ether address and post the tweet here __https://faucet.rinkeby.io/__ to get free testing ether 

- Attacks - 01:19:28
- Scalability -> sharding -> layer 1: base layer blockchain implementation -> layer 2: any application that is build on top of a layer 2 - 01:25:32

### Reacp 01:28:00
 - ETH and BTC are both proof of work (in 2022), 
 - ETH 2.0 will be proof of stake
 - POW & POS are sybil resistance mechanisms
 - The bigger the blockchain, the more secure
 - Consensus is how blockchain decide what the state of the chain is
 - Sharding and rollups are scalability solutions
 - Only so many transactions can fit into a block
